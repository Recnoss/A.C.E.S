### Advanced GitHub Contribution Tracker
**File:** `advanced_contribution_tracker.py`

A comprehensive GitHub contribution tracking system with gamification, caching, and advanced analytics.

#### **Key Features:**
- **Multi-source Data Collection**: GraphQL API + REST API fallback
- **Smart Caching**: 24-hour file-based cache for optimal performance
- **Flexible Time Ranges**: Last N days or quarterly tracking (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4)
- **Real-time Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bar with user feedback
- **Gamification System**: Points-based scoring for various contribution types
- **Dynamic Leaderboards**: Top 100 users with full name support
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Detailed error messages with HTTP status meanings

#### **Gamification Scoring System:**
| Contribution Type | Scoring Rules |
|------------------|---------------|
| **Commits** | 2 points each (capped at 100 points) |
| **Pull Requests** | 5 points + merge rate bonus (up to 20 points) |
| **Code Reviews** | 3 points each + 1 point per review comment |
| **Collaboration** | Bonus points for helping team members |
| **Consistency** | Regular activity bonuses |

#### **Usage Examples:**
```bash
# Track last 30 days (default)
python advanced_contribution_tracker.py

# Track last 90 days
python advanced_contribution_tracker.py --days 90

# Track Q1 2025
python advanced_contribution_tracker.py --quarter Q1-2025

# Track Q4 2024
python advanced_contribution_tracker.py --quarter Q4-2024

# Clear cache and run fresh
python advanced_contribution_tracker.py --clear-cache
```

#### **Requirements:**
- Python 3.7+
- GitHub Personal Access Token with repo permissions
- Required packages: `requests`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `joblib`, `tabulate`

#### **Setup:**
1. Set environment variable: `export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here`
2. Configure users in `config.json`
3. Ensure `all-users.txt` contains full name mappings
4. Run the script with desired parameters

### Legacy Scripts

#### **org_total_commits.py**
Generates organization-wide contribution rankings with caching support for historical analysis.

#### **user_contributions.py** 
Tracks individual user contributions for the previous month with lines of code delta calculations.

## Configuration Files

- **`config.json`**: Contains organization settings and user mappings
- **`all-users.txt`**: Full name to username mappings for display purposes

## Output Files

All scripts generate timestamped CSV files with detailed metrics:
- `advanced_contributions_[period]_[timestamp].csv`: Comprehensive contribution data
- `org_total_commits_[timestamp].csv`: Organization-wide commit statistics
- `user_contributions_[timestamp].csv`: Monthly user contribution reports

## Cache Management

The advanced tracker uses intelligent file-based caching:
- **Location**: `CACHE/` directory
- **Expiry**: 24 hours
- **Benefits**: Significantly faster re-runs and reduced API calls
- **Management**: Use `--clear-cache` flag to reset

## Performance Notes

- **Initial runs**: May take several minutes depending on organization size
- **Cached runs**: Complete in seconds for repeated time periods
- **Rate limiting**: Built-in handling for GitHub API limits
- **Progress tracking**: Real-time feedback for long-running operations

Feel free to explore the scripts and customize them according to your specific organizational needs. Each script includes comprehensive error handling and detailed logging for troubleshooting.
