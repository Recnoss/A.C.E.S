### Advanced GitHub Contribution Tracker
**File:** `advanced_contribution_tracker.py`

A comprehensive GitHub contribution tracking system with gamification, caching, and advanced analytics.

#### **Key Features:**
- **Multi-source Data Collection**: GraphQL API + REST API fallback
- **Smart Caching**: 24-hour file-based cache for optimal performance
- **Flexible Time Ranges**: Last N days or quarterly tracking (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4)
- **Real-time Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bar with user feedback
- **Gamification System**: Points-based scoring for various contribution types
- **Dynamic Leaderboards**: Top 100 users with full name support
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Detailed error messages with HTTP status meanings

#### **Comprehensive Gamification Scoring System:**

Our scoring system is designed to provide a balanced assessment of both individual productivity and team collaboration. Here's how each metric is calculated and why it matters:

| Contribution Type | Scoring Rules | Data Source & Calculation Method |
|------------------|---------------|----------------------------------|
| **Commits** | 2 points each (capped at 100 points) | **Data:** GitHub GraphQL `totalCommitContributions`<br>**Method:** Direct count of commits authored in time period<br>**Cap Reasoning:** Prevents volume over quality; encourages meaningful commits |
| **Pull Requests** | 5 base points + merge rate bonus (up to 20 points) | **Data:** GitHub GraphQL `totalPullRequestContributions` + PR state analysis<br>**Calculation:** `(PRs_opened √ó 5) + (merge_rate √ó 20)`<br>**Merge Rate:** `PRs_merged / PRs_opened`<br>**Quality Focus:** Rewards PRs that get accepted by the team |
| **Code Reviews** | 3 points per review + 1 point per review comment | **Data:** GitHub GraphQL `totalPullRequestReviewContributions` + comment analysis<br>**Method:** Counts reviews submitted + comments made during reviews<br>**Team Value:** Recognizes time spent helping others improve their code |
| **Collaboration** | Combined review engagement score | **Data:** Review comments + issue discussions + PR feedback<br>**Calculation:** `(reviews_given √ó 3) + (review_comments √ó 1)`<br>**Purpose:** Measures investment in team success and knowledge sharing |
| **Consistency** | Regular activity bonus | **Data:** Distribution of commits over time period<br>**Calculation:** `min(commits_count √ó 0.5, 25)`<br>**Philosophy:** Steady contribution is more valuable than sporadic bursts |

#### **Data Collection Methodology:**

**üîç Primary Data Sources:**
- **GitHub GraphQL API:** Comprehensive contribution data with precise metrics
- **GitHub REST API:** Fallback for detailed repository-level analysis
- **Time-based Filtering:** All data is filtered to the specified time period (days/quarters)

**üìä Specific Data Points Tracked:**

1. **Commit Analysis:**
   - Total commits authored in time period
   - Commits per repository (organization-scoped only)
   - Excludes forks and archived repositories for accuracy

2. **Pull Request Metrics:**
   - PRs opened, merged, closed, and still open
   - Merge success rate calculation
   - Comments received on user's PRs (engagement indicator)
   - Lines added/deleted (complexity indicator)

3. **Code Review Participation:**
   - Reviews submitted on others' PRs
   - Comments made during review process
   - Review quality through engagement metrics
   - Cross-team collaboration patterns

4. **Collaboration Tracking:**
   - Comments on team members' PRs
   - Participation in code discussions
   - Mentoring indicators through review feedback
   - Knowledge sharing through detailed comments

**üõ°Ô∏è Data Integrity & Privacy:**
- **API Permissions:** Read-only access to public organization data
- **Rate Limiting:** Built-in GitHub API rate limit handling
- **Caching:** 24-hour local cache to minimize API calls
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive fallbacks for missing or incomplete data
- **Transparency:** All calculations are logged and auditable

**‚öñÔ∏è Scoring Philosophy:**

**Quality Over Quantity:** The capped scoring system prevents gaming through volume and emphasizes meaningful contributions.

**Team-First Approach:** Heavy weighting on reviews and collaboration reflects that great developers make their entire team better.

**Sustainable Practices:** Consistency bonuses encourage healthy work-life balance over crunch periods.

**Fair Assessment:** Multiple data sources ensure no single metric dominates, providing a holistic view of contribution value.

**Recognition of "Invisible" Work:** Code reviews and mentoring finally get the recognition they deserve in team productivity.

#### **Usage Examples:**
```bash
# Track last 30 days (default)
python advanced_contribution_tracker.py

# Track last 90 days
python advanced_contribution_tracker.py --days 90

# Track Q1 2025
python advanced_contribution_tracker.py --quarter Q1-2025

# Track Q4 2024
python advanced_contribution_tracker.py --quarter Q4-2024

# Clear cache and run fresh
python advanced_contribution_tracker.py --clear-cache
```

#### **Requirements:**
- Python 3.7+
- GitHub Personal Access Token with repo permissions
- Required packages: `requests`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `joblib`, `tabulate`

#### **Setup:**
1. Set environment variable: `export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here`
2. Configure users in `config.json`
3. Ensure `all-users.txt` contains full name mappings
4. Run the script with desired parameters

### Script History

The User Management folder previously contained legacy scripts (`org_total_commits.py` and `user_contributions.py`) that have been replaced by the comprehensive `advanced_contribution_tracker.py`. The new tracker provides all functionality of the legacy scripts plus enhanced features like caching, gamification, and flexible time periods.

## Configuration Files

- **`config.json`**: Contains organization settings and user mappings
- **`all-users.txt`**: Full name to username mappings for display purposes

## Output Files

The tracker generates timestamped CSV files with detailed metrics:
- `advanced_contributions_[period]_[timestamp].csv`: Comprehensive contribution data with gamification scores

## Cache Management

The advanced tracker uses intelligent file-based caching:
- **Location**: `CACHE/` directory
- **Expiry**: 24 hours
- **Benefits**: Significantly faster re-runs and reduced API calls
- **Management**: Use `--clear-cache` flag to reset

## Performance Notes

- **Initial runs**: May take several minutes depending on organization size
- **Cached runs**: Complete in seconds for repeated time periods
- **Rate limiting**: Built-in handling for GitHub API limits
- **Progress tracking**: Real-time feedback for long-running operations

Feel free to explore the scripts and customize them according to your specific organizational needs. Each script includes comprehensive error handling and detailed logging for troubleshooting.
