python team_contribution_tracker.py --quarter Q1-2025 --top-teams 3

# Clear cache and run fresh
python team_contribution_tracker.py --clear-cache
```

#### **Team Output Files:**

- **Dynamic Leaderboards**: Top 100 users with full name support
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Detailed error messages with HTTP status meanings

#### **üèÜ Improved Gamification Scoring System:**

Our scoring system provides a balanced assessment of individual productivity and team collaboration. **Recent improvements eliminated double-counting issues** for fair and accurate rankings:

| Contribution Type | Scoring Rules | Data Source & Calculation Method |
|------------------|---------------|----------------------------------|
| **Commits** | 2 points each (capped at 100 points) | **Data:** GitHub GraphQL `totalCommitContributions` + multi-org REST fallback<br>**Method:** Direct count of commits authored across all configured organizations<br>**Cap Reasoning:** Prevents volume over quality; encourages meaningful commits |
| **Pull Requests** | 5 base points + up to 20 merge rate bonus | **Data:** GitHub GraphQL `totalPullRequestContributions` + PR state analysis<br>**Calculation:** `(PRs_opened √ó 5) + (merge_rate √ó 20)`<br>**Merge Rate:** `PRs_merged / PRs_opened`<br>**Quality Focus:** Rewards PRs that get accepted by the team |
| **Code Reviews** | 3 points per review + 1 point per review comment | **Data:** GitHub GraphQL `totalPullRequestReviewContributions` + comment analysis<br>**Method:** Counts reviews submitted + comments made during reviews<br>**Team Value:** Recognizes time spent helping others improve their code |
| **Collaboration** | 10-35 bonus points for active reviewing (**NEW**) | **Data:** Review activity patterns and engagement quality<br>**Calculation:** Bonus points for active reviewers (>5 reviews: +10, >20 comments: +15, well-rounded contributor: +10)<br>**Purpose:** **No longer duplicates review scores** - rewards exceptional collaboration |
| **Consistency** | 8 points per contribution type (max 24) (**IMPROVED**) | **Data:** Activity diversity across contribution types<br>**Calculation:** 8 points each for commits, PRs, and reviews (independent scoring)<br>**Philosophy:** **Eliminates double-counting** - rewards balanced contribution patterns |

#### **Data Collection Methodology:**

**üîç Primary Data Sources:**
- **GitHub GraphQL API:** Comprehensive contribution data with precise metrics
- **GitHub REST API:** Fallback for detailed repository-level analysis across multiple organizations
- **Multi-Organization Support:** Searches contributions across all configured organizations  
- **Time-based Filtering:** All data is filtered to the specified time period (days/quarters)

**üìä Specific Data Points Tracked:**

1. **Commit Analysis:**
   - Total commits authored in time period
   - Commits per repository (organization-scoped only)
   - Excludes forks and archived repositories for accuracy

2. **Pull Request Metrics:**
   - PRs opened, merged, closed, and still open
   - Merge success rate calculation
   - Comments received on user's PRs (engagement indicator)
   - Lines added/deleted (complexity indicator)

3. **Code Review Participation:**
   - Reviews submitted on others' PRs
   - Comments made during review process
   - Review quality through engagement metrics
   - Cross-team collaboration patterns

4. **Collaboration Tracking:**
   - Comments on team members' PRs
   - Participation in code discussions
   - Mentoring indicators through review feedback
   - Knowledge sharing through detailed comments

**üõ°Ô∏è Data Integrity & Privacy:**
- **API Permissions:** Read-only access to public organization data
- **Rate Limiting:** Built-in GitHub API rate limit handling
- **Caching:** 24-hour local cache to minimize API calls
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive fallbacks for missing or incomplete data
- **Transparency:** All calculations are logged and auditable

**‚öñÔ∏è Scoring Philosophy:**

**Quality Over Quantity:** The capped scoring system prevents gaming through volume and emphasizes meaningful contributions.

**Team-First Approach:** Heavy weighting on reviews and collaboration reflects that great developers make their entire team better.

**Sustainable Practices:** Consistency bonuses encourage healthy work-life balance over crunch periods.

**Fair Assessment:** Multiple data sources ensure no single metric dominates, providing a holistic view of contribution value.

**Recognition of "Invisible" Work:** Code reviews and mentoring finally get the recognition they deserve in team productivity.

#### **Individual Tracker Usage Examples:**
```bash
# Track last 30 days (default) across multiple orgs
python advanced_contribution_tracker.py

# Track last 90 days
python advanced_contribution_tracker.py --days 90

# Track Q1 2025
python advanced_contribution_tracker.py --quarter Q1-2025

# Clear cache and run fresh
python advanced_contribution_tracker.py --clear-cache
```

#### **Combined Usage Workflow:**
```bash
# 1. Set up multiple organizations
export GITHUB_ORG=statisticsnorway
export GITHUB_ORG_2=PxTools

# 2. Run individual tracking first
python advanced_contribution_tracker.py --days 30

# 3. Then run team analysis on the same period
python team_contribution_tracker.py --days 30 --top-teams 5

# 4. Compare individual vs team performance
# Individual CSV: advanced_contributions_30days_[timestamp].csv
# Team CSV: team_contributions_30days_[timestamp]_teams.csv
```

#### **Requirements:**
- Python 3.7+
- GitHub Personal Access Token with repo permissions
- Required packages: `requests`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `joblib`, `tabulate`

#### **Setup:**
1. **Set environment variables:**
   ```bash
   export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
   export GITHUB_ORG=your_primary_org
   export GITHUB_ORG_2=your_secondary_org  # Optional
   ```

2. **Configure `config.json`:**
   ```json
   {
     "users": {
       "github-username": "Display Name"
     },
     "teams": {
       "team-slug": "Team Display Name"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Run the trackers:**
   - Individual: `python advanced_contribution_tracker.py`
   - Teams: `python team_contribution_tracker.py`

### Script History

The User Management folder previously contained legacy scripts (`org_total_commits.py` and `user_contributions.py`) that have been replaced by the comprehensive `advanced_contribution_tracker.py`. The new tracker provides all functionality of the legacy scripts plus enhanced features like caching, gamification, and flexible time periods.

## Configuration Files

- **`config.json`**: Contains organization settings and user mappings
- **`all-users.txt`**: Full name to username mappings for display purposes

## Output Files

### Individual Tracker Output:
- `advanced_contributions_[period]_[timestamp].csv`: Comprehensive individual contribution data with gamification scores

### Team Tracker Output:
- `team_contributions_[period]_[timestamp]_teams.csv`: Team summary with rankings, totals, and averages
- `team_contributions_[period]_[timestamp]_members_by_team.csv`: Individual members organized by team affiliation

## Cache Management

The advanced tracker uses intelligent file-based caching:
- **Location**: `CACHE/` directory
- **Expiry**: 24 hours
- **Benefits**: Significantly faster re-runs and reduced API calls
- **Management**: Use `--clear-cache` flag to reset

## Performance Notes

- **Initial runs**: May take several minutes depending on organization size
- **Cached runs**: Complete in seconds for repeated time periods
- **Rate limiting**: Built-in handling for GitHub API limits
- **Progress tracking**: Real-time feedback for long-running operations

Feel free to explore the scripts and customize them according to your specific organizational needs. Each script includes comprehensive error handling and detailed logging for troubleshooting.
