# Vulnerability Tracker

A customizable tool for tracking and visualizing security vulnerabilities over time across different teams.

## Overview

The Vulnerability Tracker helps security administrators monitor and analyze the number of security vulnerabilities found by various scanning tools across different teams. It provides a flexible framework that can be adapted to any organization's structure and tooling, with a simple interface for monthly data entry and visualization generation.

## Features

- **Customizable teams and scanners**: Define your own teams and vulnerability scanning tools
- **Easy initialization**: Simple setup process to configure the tool for your environment
- **Monthly data entry**: Track Critical, High, and Medium vulnerabilities (or customize severity levels)
- **Smart timeline visualization**: Generate trend graphs with consistent date ranges, from the earliest to the latest data point, automatically handling gaps in data
- **Summary reports**: Get quick insights into current vulnerability status
- **Historical data listing**: Review all previously entered data
- **Automated graph generation**: Save visualizations for reports and presentations

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Required Python packages:
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - tabulate

### Setup

1. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib tabulate
```

2. Clone or download this repository.

3. Initialize the tool (only needed once):

```bash
python vulnerability_tracker.py init
```

During initialization, you'll be prompted to enter your team names and scanner tools.

## Usage

### Adding Vulnerability Data

Add vulnerability data for the current month:

```bash
python vulnerability_tracker.py add
```

Add vulnerability data for a specific month:

```bash
python vulnerability_tracker.py add --date 2023-05
```

During data entry, you'll be prompted to enter the number of vulnerabilities by severity level for each team and scanner combination.

### Viewing Data

List all recorded vulnerability data:

```bash
python vulnerability_tracker.py list
```

Show a summary of the current vulnerability status:

```bash
python vulnerability_tracker.py summary
```

### Visualizing Data

Create standard visualizations for each team and vulnerability level:

```bash
python vulnerability_tracker.py visualize
```

Create a combined visualization showing total vulnerabilities by team:

```bash
python vulnerability_tracker.py visualize --combined
```

Save visualizations without displaying them:

```bash
python vulnerability_tracker.py visualize --save-only
```

#### Timeline Visualization Features

- **Automatic date range**: Visualizations always include the complete range from the earliest to latest data points
- **Continuous timeline**: All months are shown in sequence, even if no data was entered for some months
- **Clear data markers**: Circular markers indicate actual data points for better readability
- **Smart formatting**: Date labels are formatted as "Month Year" (e.g., "Jan 2023") with appropriate rotation
- **Consistent scaling**: All charts in the detailed view use the same time scale for easy comparison

## Data Structure

The tool maintains the following files:

- **config.json**: Stores your configuration (teams, scanners, vulnerability levels)
- **vulnerability_data.csv**: Contains all vulnerability data entries
- **plots/**: Directory containing generated visualization images

## Example Output

### Summary View

```
Vulnerability Summary (as of 2023-05)
+------------+----------+------+--------+-------+
| Team       | Critical | High | Medium | Total |
+------------+----------+------+--------+-------+
| Team1      | 7        | 15   | 31     | 53    |
| Team2      | 3        | 9    | 17     | 29    |
| Team3      | 2        | 12   | 22     | 36    |
+------------+----------+------+--------+-------+
```

## Customization

The tool can be reconfigured at any time:

```bash
python vulnerability_tracker.py init
```

This will allow you to redefine your teams and scanners. Note that this won't affect existing data, but may cause misalignment if team or scanner names change.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the script:

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed
2. Check write permissions for the `data` directory
3. Verify that the configuration file hasn't been corrupted
4. For visualization errors, ensure that the data CSV format matches your configuration
